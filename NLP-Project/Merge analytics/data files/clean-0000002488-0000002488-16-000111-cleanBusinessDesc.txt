 potential certain products excluded markets materially adversely affect us
certain environmental laws including u s
comprehensive environmental response compensation liability act superfund act impose strict certain circumstances joint several liability current previous owners operators real property cost removal remediation hazardous substances impose liability damages natural resources
 laws often impose liability even owner operator know responsible release hazardous substances
 environmental laws also assess liability persons arrange hazardous substances sent disposal treatment facilities facilities found contaminated
