 believe material compliance applicable environmental requirements expect requirements result material expenditures foreseeable future
environmental laws complex change frequently tended become stringent time
 example european union eu china among growing number jurisdictions enacted restrictions use lead materials electronic products

 many sources materials new requirements unlikely affect sourcing minerals used manufacture semiconductor devices will add additional costs associated complying disclosure requirements costs related determining source conflict minerals used products auditing process reporting customers us government
also since supply chain complex may face reputational challenges unable sufficiently verify origins subject minerals
moreover may encounter challenges satisfy customers require compnts products certified conflict free satisfy customers may choose competitor s products
 number jurisdictions including eu australia china developing finalizing market entry public procurement requirements computers servers based energy star specification well additional energy consumption limits
