lmr systems constructed meet organization s specific communications needs
 cost complete system can vary widely depending size configuration
likewise cost radio sets can range basic analog portable thousands dollars fully featured p digital unit
typically recurring airtime usage charges
accordingly lmr usage patterns considerably different cellular wireless communications tools
lmr usage often consists direct radio radio communications outside range communication nerk many members group

lmr systems widely used longest used form wireless dispatch communications u s
 first placed service lmr initially used almost exclusively law enforcement radio communications transmitted analog format
analog transmissions typically consist voice signal modulated directly onto continuous radio carrier wave

responding growing usage additional radio frequency spectrum allocated federal communications commission fcc lmr use
 recently growth lmr industry slowed reflecting several factors lmr mature industry existence years lmr users mature industry segments experienced slow growth rates funding budgets government public safety agencies constrained limited availability radio frequency spectrum hinders existing users expanding systems potential new users establishing new systems

 addition u s
federal government grant programs provide assistance funding state local agencies purchase interoperable communications equipment first responders strongly encourage compliance p standards
accordingly although funding lmr purchases many government agencies limited believe users upgrade equipment achieve interoperability comply fcc narrow banding mandates demand p equipment will continue grow

manufacturing raw materials manufacturing strategy utilize highest quality cost effective resources available every aspect manufacturing
consistent strategy many years successfully utilized outside contract arrangements different segments manufacturing operations
 arrangements offshore concerns managed updated meet present requirements continue instrumental controlling product costs allowing us competitive manage gross margins
contract manufacturers produce various subassemblies products behalf
generally contract manufacturers procure raw materials relm approved sources complete manufacturing activities accordance specifications
manufacturing agreements purchase orders govern business relationship contract manufacturers
 agreements purchase orders various terms conditions may renewed modified upon agreement parties

 plan continue utilizing contract manufacturing furthers business objectives
 strategy allows us focus core technological competencies product design development reduce substantial capital investment required manufacture products
 also believe use experienced high volume manufacturers will provide greater manufacturing specialization expertise higher levels flexibility responsiveness faster delivery product contribute toward product cost control
 ensure products manufactured others meet quality standards production engineering team works closely iso industry qualified contract manufacturers key aspects production process
 establish product specifications select compnts cases suppliers
 retain document control
 also work contract manufacturers improve process control product design conduct periodic site inspections
 rely upon limited number domestic foreign suppliers several key products compnts
approximately material subassembly product procurements sourced suppliers
 place purchase orders time time suppliers guaranteed supply arrangements
 addition certain compnts obtained single sources
 operations materially impaired due delays single source suppliers
however absence single source compnt potentially delay manufacture finished products
 manage risk delays securing secondary sources possible redesigning products response compnt shortages obsolescence
