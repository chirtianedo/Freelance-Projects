lmr systems constructed meet organization s specific communication needs
 cost complete system can vary widely depending size configuration
likewise cost radio sets can range basic analog portable thousands dollars fully featured p digital unit
typically recurring airtime usage charges
accordingly lmr usage patterns considerably different cellular wireless communications tools
lmr usage characterized frequent calls short duration
 typical user may transmit receive calls per day calls lasting less seconds
 average useful life unit can vary depending upon application unit deployed handling
lmr systems widely used longest used form wireless dispatch communications united states first placed service lmr initially used almost exclusively law enforcement radio communications transmitted analog format
analog transmissions typically consist voice signal modulated directly onto continuous radio carrier wave
 time advances technology decreased cost lmr products increased popularity usage businesses agencies
 respond growing usage additional radio frequency spectrum allocated federal communications commission fcc lmr use
 recently lmr industry characterized slow growth reflecting several factors lmr mature industry existence years lmr users mature industry segments experienced slow growth rates funding budgets government public safety agencies reduced significantly growth hampered lack available radio frequency spectrum prevented existing users expanding systems hindered efforts many potential new users obtaining licenses new systems
years ago result limited spectrum availability fcc mandated new lmr equipment utilize technology spectrum efficient
 effectively meant industry migrate digital technology
responding mandate association public safety communications officials apco concert several lmr manufacturers including relm recommended standard digital lmr devices meet fcc spectrum efficiency requirements provide solutions several problems experienced primarily public safety users
 standard called project
 primary objectives project allow effective reliable communication among users compliant equipment regardless manufacturer known interoperability ii maximize radio spectrum efficiency iii promote competition among lmr providers open system architecture
although fcc require public safety agencies radio users purchase p equipment otherwise adopt standard compliance standard primary consideration government public safety purchasers
accordingly although funding lmr purchases many government agencies limited anticipate demand p equipment will ultimately increase fuel greater lmr market growth users upgrade equipment achieve interoperability comply fcc mandate
presently migration p equipment primarily limited government public safety agencies
radio users business industrial market continue utilize predominantly analog lmr products
