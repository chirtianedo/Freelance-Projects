 party can terminate cross license agreement rights licenses party party materially breaches cross license agreement correct noticed material breach within days
upon termination terminated party s license rights terminate terminating party s license rights continue subject party s continued compliance terms cross license agreement
 cross license agreement will automatically terminate party undergoes change control defined cross license agreement parties licenses will terminate
upon bankruptcy party party may assume may assign cross license agreement event cross license agreement assumed cross license agreement licenses granted will terminate
backlog sales made primarily pursuant purchase orders current delivery agreements covering purchases period time
 orders agreements may revised canceled without penalty
generally light current industry practice believe orders agreements provide meaningful backlog figures necessarily indicative actual sales succeeding period

environmental regulations many aspects business operations products regulated domestic international environmental laws regulations
 regulations include limitations discharge pollutants air water soil remediation requirements product chemical content limitations manufacturing chemical use handling restrictions pollution control requirements waste minimization considerations requirements respect treatment transport storage disposal solid hazardous wastes
 fail comply applicable environmental regulations may subject fines suspension production alteration manufacturing processes import export restrictions sales limitations criminal civil liabilities
existing future regulations require us procure expensive pollution abatement remediation equipment modify product designs incur expenses comply environmental regulations
 failure adequately control use disposal storage discharge hazardous substances expose us future liabilities material adverse effect business
 believe material compliance applicable environmental requirements expect requirements result material expenditures foreseeable future
environmental laws complex change frequently tended become stringent time
 example european union eu china among growing number jurisdictions enacted restrictions use lead materials electronic products
 regulations affect semiconductor devices packaging
 regulations restricting materials electronic products continue increase around world risk cost quality manufacturing yields products subject restrictions may less favorable compared products subject restrictions transition compliant products may meet customer road maps produce sudden changes demand may result excess inventory
 number jurisdictions including eu australia china developing finalized market entry public procurement regulations computers servers based energy star specifications well additional energy consumption limits
 potential certain products excluded markets materially adversely affect us
recent u s
legislation includes disclosure reporting requirements companies use conflict minerals originate democratic republic congo adjoining countries
 will likely incur additional costs associated complying requirements costs related determining source conflict minerals used products auditing process reporting customers u s
government
also since supply chain complex may face reputational challenges unable sufficiently verify origins subject minerals
moreover likely encounter challenges satisfy customers require compnts products certified conflict free
 satisfy customers may choose competitor s products
 number jurisdictions including eu australia china developing finalized market entry public procurement regulations computers servers based energy star specifications well additional energy consumption limits
 potential certain products excluded markets materially adversely affect us
 budgeted foreseeable associated expenditures assure future environmental legal requirements will become stringent costly future
therefore assure costs complying current future environmental health safety laws liabilities arising past future releases exposure hazardous substances will material adverse effect us
