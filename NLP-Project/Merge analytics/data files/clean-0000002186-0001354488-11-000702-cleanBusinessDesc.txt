industry overview land mobile radio lmr communications consist hand held portable mobile vehicle mounted way radios commonly used public safety sector e g
police fire emergency responders commercial business concerns e g
corporate disaster recovery hotels airports farms transportation service providers construction firms government agencies within united states abroad
lmr systems constructed meet organization s specific communication needs
 cost complete system can vary widely depending size configuration
likewise cost radio sets can range basic analog portable thousands dollars fully featured p digital unit
typically recurring airtime usage charges
accordingly lmr usage patterns considerably different cellular wireless communications tools
lmr usage characterized frequent calls short duration
 typical user may transmit receive calls per day calls lasting less seconds
 average useful life unit can vary depending upon application whi ch unit deployed handling
lmr systems widely used longest used form wireless dispatch communications united states first placed service lmr initially used almost exclusively law enforcement radio communications transmitted analog format
analog transmissions typically consist voice signal modulated directly onto continuous radio carrier wave
 time advances technology decreased cost lmr products increased popularity usage businesses agencies
 respond growing usage additional radio frequency spectrum allocated federal communications commission fcc lmr use
 recent years lmr industry typically characterized slow growth reflecting several factors lmr mature industry existence almost years lmr users mature industry segments experienced slow growth rates significantly growth hampered lack available radio frequency spectrum prevented existing users expanding systems hindered efforts many potential new users obtaining licenses new systems
years ago result limited spectrum availability fcc mandated new lmr equipment utilize technology spectrum efficient
 effectively meant industry migrate digital technology
responding mandate association public safety communications officials apco concert several lmr manufacturers including relm recommended standard digital lmr devices meet fcc spectrum efficiency requirements provide solutions several problems experienced primarily public safety users
 standard called project
 primary objectives project allow effective reliable communication among users compliant equipment regardless manufacturer known interoperability ii maximize radio spectrum efficiency iii promote competition among lmr providers open system architecture
although fcc require public safety agencies radio users purchase p equipment otherwise adopt standard compliance standard primary consideration government public safety purchasers
accordingly although lmr spending many federal government agencies increased slightly following declines anticipate demand p equipment will steadily meaningfully increase ultimately fuel lmr market growth users upgrade equipment achieve interoperability comply fcc mandate
presently migration p equipment primarily limited government public safety agencies
radio users business industrial market continue utilize predominantly analog lmr products
 estimates north american lmr market infrastructure subscriber units approximately billion annual sales
presently market dominated supplier motorola solutions however open architecture p standard designed eliminate ability suppliers lockout competitors
formerly proprietary characteristics incorporated many analog lmr systems customer effectively precluded purchasing additional lmr products supplier initial supplier system
additionally system infrastructure technology prohibitive smaller suppliers develop
